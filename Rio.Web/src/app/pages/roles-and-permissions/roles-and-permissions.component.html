                    Public users do not have an account or are not logged into the web application. Public
                    users can only view the homepage and pages under the Learn More menu.

                <dd class="p-2">
                    Landowners use the platform to manage their water usage and trade water (if trading is
                    enabled in the platform). A user with the Landowner role must be assigned at least one billing
                    account before they can meaningfully use the platform. Landowners can view their Landowner Dashboard
                    and access all items in the Trade Menu. A Landowner cannot view any of the pages under the Manage
                    Menu.

                <dd class="p-2">
                    Administrators have access to all pages in the application. Administrators can assign other users a
                    role, as well as manage the system (including customizing rich text pages). The Administrator role
                    should be limited to a few users who understand the tool and need access to add/edit accounts and
                    manage user roles.

                <dd class="p-2">
                    A Demo User has similar access as a Landowner and must be assigned at least one billing account to
                    start trading. However, they have additional read-only permission to view all pages in the Manage
                    Menu.

                <dt>Unassigned</dt>
                <dd class="p-2">
                    Unassigned users have a system account but have not been assigned a role by an Administrator. These
                    users have the same permissions as Public users. A new user who signs up on their own will
                    automatically be assigned this role.

                <dd class="p-2">
                    Disabled users have the same permissions as Public and Unassigned users. An administrator may assign
                    this role to users who created an account by accident, or who no longer have a valid reason to
                    remain in the platform - for example a former Landowner who has left the district, or a previous
                    employee who is no longer with your organization.
