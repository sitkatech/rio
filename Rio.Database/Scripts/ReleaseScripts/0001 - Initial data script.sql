(3, 3, N'<h4>Overview</h4><p><br><strong>Why was this platform developed?</strong></p><p>In 2014 California passed the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (SGMA), which requires that each groundwater basin balance their groundwater supply and demand by 2040 or 2042. This online Water Accounting and Trading Platform was developed to help the Rosedale-Rio Bravo Water Storage District (Rosedale) comply with SGMA and provide landowners access to up-to-date information on their water supply and consumptive use. The platform enables landowners to make informed decisions related to water supply and land use.&nbsp;</p><p>Rosedale launched the accounting section of the platform in March 2020 and will launch the trading section when needed, possibly in 2021.</p><p><strong>How is this platform relevant to regions outside of Rosedale’s service area?</strong></p><p>The platform was developed with open-source software to allow other water districts in the Central Valley and beyond to utilize and customize the platform. Rosedale believes that the platform is an important part of SGMA compliance and that landowners will make better decisions when provided with the most up-to-date information related to water supply and demand.</p><p>Because Rosedale’s platform includes private landowner information, this demonstration version of the platform (waterplatform.edf.org) was created with anonymized landowner data from Rosedale to enable other water agencies to explore the tool’s features.</p><p><strong>Who can currently access the Rosedale platform?</strong></p><p>Any landowner within the Rosedale service area may register to access their information at&nbsp;<a href="https://waterbudget.rrbwsd.com/">waterbudget.rrbwsd.com</a><a href="file:///C:/Users/cbabbitt/Downloads/waterbudget.rrbwsd.com">.</a> The Rosedale platform uses the assessor''s parcel number as the basis of the water budget or “account,” much like a bank account number. The platform lets the registered landowner see water information related to parcels they own.</p><p><strong>Who was involved in the development of the Rosedale and demonstration platforms?</strong></p><p>The platforms were co-developed in partnership with and with funding assistance from Rosedale and Environmental Defense Fund, with technical assistance from Sitka Technology Group, WestWater Research and OpenET. &nbsp;</p><p>For added functionality, the Water Accounting and Trading Platform uses the&nbsp;<a href="https://waterplatform.edf.org/about-groundwater-evaluation">Groundwater Evaluation Toolbox</a>&nbsp;(GET) developed by Olsson to gain a better understanding of the potential impacts and benefits of water management strategies, such as water trading or recharge activities, prior to taking action.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h4>EDF Demonstration Platform Functionality</h4><p><br><strong>How do I sign up to explore the demonstration platform?</strong></p><p>New participants can sign up for a user profile in the EDF demonstration platform (waterplatform.edf.org) by clicking “Create Account” on the&nbsp;<a href="https://waterplatform.edf.org/">homepage</a> and following the instructions to verify the account and create a password.<br><br>Administrators will receive notifications every time a new user signs up to participate and must assign the new user permissions before the user can get started. The new user will receive a notification email when their account has been configured (usually within 48 hours).</p><p><strong>How can I reset my password?</strong></p><p>Users can access the following links “Forgot Password," “Forgot Username” or "Request Support” on the Create Account, Log In and homepage.</p><p><strong>How does the platform work?</strong></p><p>After a user is granted access to the site and is assigned a role (i.e. “demo user”) by the site administrator, they will be able to start using the platform. Upon login, a landowner will automatically be redirected to their Landowner Dashboard, where they can view summary information for parcels they own.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>How can I learn more?</strong></p><p>To learn more about the Water Accounting and Trading Platform and how it can be adapted to meet your local water management needs, please contact:&nbsp;<br><br>Christina Babbitt<br>Senior Manager<br>California Groundwater Program<br>Environmental Defense Fund&nbsp;<br><a href="mailto:cbabbitt@edf.org">cbabbitt@edf.org</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Water Accounting</h2><p><br><strong>How is water use being tracked or accounted for?</strong></p><p>Water use is being tracked using satellite-based estimates of evapotranspiration (ET) provided by the <a href="https://openetdata.org/"><strong>OpenET</strong></a> platform.&nbsp;</p><p>When it launches publicly in 2021, OpenET will provide near real-time ET estimates to farmers and landowners through an easily accessible online platform.&nbsp;OpenET will provide equal access to water data to all decision-makers, giving farmers and landowners the opportunity to see the same data that water managers and regulators are using.&nbsp;<a href="https://waterplatform.edf.org/measuring-water-use-with-openet">Learn more here</a>.</p><p><strong>Why was OpenET used?</strong></p><p>Rosedale chose to partner with OpenET because the project is bringing some of the leading scientists and most well-established approaches for estimating ET together in one place, helping to create a consensus around water data for decision-making.</p><p>A couple of unique&nbsp;features of Rosedale’s physical setting also make OpenET an appropriate tool for net measurement of groundwater use. First, nearly all water used for irrigation within Rosedale is groundwater pumped from the aquifer underlying the district, as opposed to surface water brought in from outside the district. Although outside surface water supplies are used for groundwater recharge within RRB, surface water is not directly delivered to irrigators. Second, because of Rosedale’s subsurface geology, nearly all applied irrigation water that is not consumptively used by the crops becomes groundwater recharge, returning to the aquifer for later use. Due to these unique circumstances, use of OpenET as a direct measure of net water use from the aquifer is a reasonable approach.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Can other regions use OpenET to measure net water use?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>In many other settings, additional complexities in water supply or return flows make direct use of ET measurement insufficient as a measure of net groundwater use. Some of the complexities that may occur include: 1) a combination of groundwater and surface water supplies is used for irrigation; 2) locations where extensive low permeability layers exist in the soil; 3) locations where &nbsp;deeper geologic formations impede deep percolation below irrigated lands from returning to the regional aquifer; and 4)&nbsp; portions of applied water might return to agricultural drains or nearby streams, and therefore do not recharge the aquifer from which the water was withdrawn.&nbsp;</p><p>In more complex settings, OpenET will be a helpful contribution to a robust groundwater monitoring program, but a combination of tools will likely be needed to effectively measure the net water use for a suitable accounting system.</p>'),

(7, 7, N'<p><strong>Tracking water use</strong></p><p>Water use calculations on this accounting platform are provided by <a href="https://openetdata.org/">OpenET</a> — a web-based platform being developed to provide consistent, trusted estimates of consumptive water use at the field scale. OpenET uses publicly available satellite and weather data to estimate evapotranspiration (ET) — water that is transferred from the land to the atmosphere via evaporation from bare soil and transpiration through plant leaves. For irrigated agricultural fields, ET is necessary for plant growth and food production and is the largest consumptive use of water by the agricultural sector. The NASA/U.S. Geological Society Landsat satellite is the primary satellite system used to produce ET information at the 30-meter scale.<br><br>Several methods exist for measuring ET at the field scale, which has created some confusion about the data. Rosedale-Rio Bravo Water Storage District chose to partner with OpenET because it is bringing leading scientists and some of the most well-established approaches for estimating ET together in one place, in an open and transparent way, helping to create consensus around the data for decision-making.</p><p>A couple of unique&nbsp;features of Rosedale’s physical setting also make OpenET an appropriate tool for net measurement of groundwater use. First, nearly all water used for irrigation within Rosedale is groundwater pumped from the aquifer underlying the district, as opposed to surface water brought in from outside the district.

Second, because of Rosedale’s subsurface geology, nearly all applied irrigation water that is not consumptively used by the crops becomes groundwater recharge, returning to the aquifer for later use. Due to these unique circumstances, use of OpenET as a direct measure of net water use from the aquifer is a reasonable approach.&nbsp;</p><p>Because the OpenET platform is still currently under development, data provided for the Water the Accounting and Trading Platform are for user testing purposes only. However, with further work on a model intercomparison study and refinements, the objective of OpenET is to provide broadly trusted ET estimates that are well-documented, easily retrieved and truly representative of the best available science.</p><p><strong>Public Availability</strong></p><p>When it launches publicly in 2021, OpenET will provide near real-time ET estimates to farmers and landowners through an easily accessible online platform.</p><p><strong>The OpenET Team</strong></p><p>The OpenET project is being led by NASA, Desert Research Institute (DRI), Environmental Defense Fund and web development firm HabitatSeven, with in-kind support from Google Earth Engine. The technical team includes approximately 30 researchers and practitioners with expertise in satellite-based estimation of evapotranspiration, cloud computing and user-driven website design from NASA, DRI, Habitat Seven, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the U.S. Geological Survey, University of Nebraska, University of Idaho, University of Wisconsin, University of Maryland, and California State University Monterey Bay.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Data Accuracy and Refinement</strong></p><p>OpenET is providing evapotranspiration data derived from several models that integrate satellite and meteorological data to generate ET estimates at the field scale. Recent advances in remote sensing of ET have led to significant improvements in the ability to automate the operation of these methodologies, and many of these methods are already informing water use decisions across the western United States. The OpenET project is advancing understanding and trust in ET data by making it much easier to compare the models at scale. This allows for identification of differences between the various methods and further refinement of the estimates.<br><br>As a critical component of this process, the OpenET team is initiating one of the largest ET model intercomparison and accuracy assessments conducted to date. The results will inform the calculation of an improved ensemble value from the full suite of ET models, developed and endorsed by the community of scientists working on OpenET.<br><br>The data currently in the Rosedale Accounting Platform represent the OpenET team’s preliminary estimate of an ensemble value. However, please keep in mind that the science and accuracy will likely advance over the coming year as the intercomparison study progresses, and as additional lessons are learned and approaches are improved.<br><br><strong>Appeal Process</strong></p><p>Rosedale has implemented a process to enable a landowner to appeal the evapotranspiration data used in the district’s water budget analysis and displayed on the Rosedale Water Accounting Platform. To initiate an appeal, the landowner must come into the district office, complete an appeals form, and provide alternative data to support the claim that there is a discrepancy. The alternative data must demonstrate a difference of greater than 10% between the district water budget information and the alternative data provided by the landowner.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>Acceptable landowner data shall be limited to:</p><ol><li>A flow meter installed on the production well.</li><li>Power bills for the period in question along with a pump test conducted within the last five years.</li></ol><p>After the appeal form has been completed and the alternative data provided, the district shall have 60 days to make a determination.
