            <p>
                Rosedale-Rio Bravo Water Storage District (“Rosedale”) has partnered with Environmental Defense Fund,
                Sitka Technology Group, OpenET, and WestWater Research to develop an online water accounting platform.
                The accounting platform was designed for Rosedale and its landowners to facilitate the effective accounting
                and management of available water resources within the district, to help Rosedale achieve groundwater
                sustainability goals, and to minimize economic costs to the community.

            <p><strong>OpenET</strong></p>
            <p>OpenET provides access to more transparent, broadly trusted estimates of water use (evapotranspiration, or ET)
               using publicly available data from multiple satellites and weather stations. The OpenET project team includes
               leading national and international experts in remote sensing of ET, cloud computing, water policy, and water 
               markets, partnered with nationally recognized web development teams and leaders in the western agriculture and
               water management communities. Rosedale has partnered with the OpenET project to understand how data on evapotranspiration
               and consumptive use can be utilized to support implementation of the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act in ways
               that provide value to all stakeholders.
